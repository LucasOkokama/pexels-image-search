# About the project
Wemage is a React-based website that allows users to search and view photos using the [`Pexels API`](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/). To use it, simply enter keywords in the search box to find matching images. For each image, you can visit the photographerâ€™s page, view it in full screen, and download it in high quality. The site is fully responsive, features a light/dark mode switch, and includes a pagination system to prevent excessive image loading at once. Additionally, images are displayed in a masonry layout, ensuring a smooth and dynamic browsing experience.

# Tech Stack
The project was developed using React, with HTML and TypeScript for page structure. Styling is achieved through a combination of CSS, TailwindCSS, and Styled Components, ensuring a modern and flexible design. To fetch images, the Pexels API was integrated, allowing users to search and display photos based on their entered keywords.
