# About the project
Wemage is a React-based website that allows users to search and view photos using the [`Pexels API`](https://www.pexels.com/api/documentation/). To use it, simply enter keywords in the search box to find matching images. For each image, you can visit the photographerâ€™s page, view it in full screen, and download it in high quality. The site is fully responsive, features a light/dark mode switch, and includes a pagination system to prevent excessive image loading at once. Additionally, images are displayed in a masonry layout, ensuring a smooth and dynamic browsing experience.

# Tech Stack
The project was developed using React, with HTML and TypeScript for page structure. Styling is achieved through a combination of CSS, TailwindCSS, and Styled Components, ensuring a modern and flexible design. To fetch images, the Pexels API was integrated, allowing users to search and display photos based on their entered keywords.

# Requirements
1. Install [`.NET SDK`](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) (includes .NET Runtime).
2. Install [`SQL Server Express`](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads).
3. Install an IDE of your choice. I personally recommend [`Visual Studio`](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) [OPTIONAL].

# How to run locally (command line)
1. Run a `git clone` of the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/LucasOkokama/home-book-app-aspnetmvc.git
```
2. Open the `home-book-app-aspnetmvc` folder and Install the `dependencies`:
```
cd home-book-app-aspnetmvc
dotnet restore
```
3. It may be necessary to update the connection string in the `appsettings.json`. Make sure to replace `NBLUCAS` with YOUR appropriate server name. If you're not using Windows Authentication (`Trusted_Connection=True`), ensure you add your `User Id` and `Password` for SQL Server Authentication.
```
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=NBLUCAS\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=HomeBookApp;Trusted_Connection=True;TrustServerCertificate=true"
}
```
4. Install the `dotnet-ef` tool:
```
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```
5. Open the `HomeBookApp.Infrastructure` folder and `Run the migrations`:
```
cd HomeBookApp.Infrastructure
dotnet ef database update --startup-project ../homebookapp
```
6. Open the `HomeBookApp` folder and `Run the project`:
```
cd ../homebookapp
dotnet run
```
7. Access `localhost` to open the website:
```
http://localhost:5129
```
